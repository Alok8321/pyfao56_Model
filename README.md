# pyfao56 Model
pyfao56 is a model for estimating crop water use and irrigation scheduling based on FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach. The pyfao56 model is implemented in Python and provides a convenient way to calculate evapotranspiration. It takes input parameters such as meteorological data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and crop coefficients to compute ET rates for specific crop types and land surfaces.
