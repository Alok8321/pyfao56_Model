# pyfao56 Model
pyfao56 is a model for estimating crop water use and irrigation scheduling based on FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach. The pyfao56 model is implemented in Python and provides a convenient way to calculate evapotranspiration. It takes input parameters such as meteorological data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and crop coefficients to compute ET rates for specific crop types and land surfaces.
In this model I used autoirrigate class to get Evaporation, Transpiration, Crop Evapotranspiration, Irrigation, Deep percolation etc.
# Autoirrigate Class
While users have the flexibility to define irrigation management schedules manually using the Irrigation class, the AutoIrrigate class within pyfao56 offers an automated approach for computing irrigation schedules. The AutoIrrigate class provides so many parameters that can be used to customize automatic irrigation scheduling in pyfao56. Parameters for controlling autoirrigation timing include the start and end dates for the autoirrigation time period, day(s) of the week that irrigation is permitted, consideration of forecasted precipitation events, managment allowed depletion, the transpiration reduction coefficient (Ks) below a critical value, and days since last irrigation or watering event.
